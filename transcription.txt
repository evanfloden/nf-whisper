 It's very hot today, isn't it? Yes, it's so hot. It looks like summer is officially starting. I'll have to remember to buy some sunblock then. My name is John, by the way. I'm Yumi. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. Are you from around here? No, I'm from Hokkaido in Japan. It's much colder than here, even in summer. What's the weather like in your hometown at this time of year? I'm from London. It rains a lot there, so I'm not used to these summer temperatures. Oh, really? I like summer because we can go and spend time at the beach. I take my dog every time. He loves to run into the sea. What do you normally do in the summer in London? If it's sunny, we often meet up and have picnics in the park. London has some really nice parks. Have you ever been there? I've never been there, but I've always wanted to visit the museums. What do people do in their free time there? People often go to watch football games at the weekend. Everyone is very passionate about their favorite team. That sounds like baseball in Japan. It's super popular.
